# Fresh-Install-PythonScript
This program creates a good vim enviourment (using LunarVim) and adds my dotfiles to it. <br />
The program is capable of running on a lot of Debian, Arch, Fedora based distros. <br />
It does some configuration of the OS and installs some additional programs! <br />
Read the code and you will see what it installs.

<br />

# Easy install
git clone https://github.com/MaliciousXatt/Fresh-Install-PythonScript.git <br />
cd Fresh-Install-PythonScript <br />
python3 FreshInstallScript.py

# Recommendations
I'd suggest installing Nerd-Fonts after the install, <br />
Other ZSH/BASH
